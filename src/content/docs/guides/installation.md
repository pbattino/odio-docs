description: Install odio on a Raspberry Pi or any Debian-based system.
---

odio turns a Raspberry Pi (or any Debian-based system) into a complete audio streamer: Bluetooth speaker, AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect, UPnP/DLNA, multi-room, CD player, USB playback — all running in your user session on standard Debian-based systems.

## Why odio?

odio started as a personal setup in 2020 — a Raspberry Pi wired to a stereo amplifier, replacing a pile of dedicated devices with a single board. After years of daily use and iteration, odio packages that setup for anyone to use. Every component is independent and can be set up from scratch individually.

The full journey that led to odio is documented on [Medium](https://mathieu-requillart.medium.com/my-ultimate-guide-to-the-raspberry-pi-audio-server-i-wanted-introduction-650020d135e1).

## Getting started

Two paths, same result:

- **Flash an image** — use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) with a custom repository URL. Configure hostname, SSH & WiFi, then flash. Your Pi boots ready.

- **Run the installer** — on an existing Debian 13 (trixie) or Ubuntu system:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://beta.odio.love/install | bash
  ```

Both paths produce the same stack: same packages, same services, same configuration.

## What you get

Once installed, your odio node is controllable from:

- **[Embedded web UI](/guides/embedded-ui/)** — built into the API, accessible from any browser on your network.
- **[odio application](https://pwa.odio.love)** — web app installable from your browser, manage all your nodes from one place.
- **[Home Assistant](https://github.com/b0bbywan/odio-ha)** — native integration via HACS. Every feature exposed as HA entities.
- **Any MPD client** — for library browsing and playback control.
- **The REST API** — for automation, scripting, or building your own client.

For a deeper look at how the stack is put together, see [How it works](/guides/how-it-works/).
